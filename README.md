**OpenSTLinux distribution** is a Linux® distribution based on the OpenEmbedded build framework.
It includes the following collection of software components. 
* OpenSTLinux BSP (OP-TEE secure OS, boot chain and Linux kernel): 
  * The boot chain based on TF-A and U-Boot 
  * The OP-TEE secure OS running on the Cortex®-A in secure mode 
  * The Linux kernel running on the Cortex®-A in non-secure mode 
* Application frameworks such as the following Linux application frameworks (non-exhaustive list): 
  * Wayland-Weston as a display/graphic framework 
  * Gstreamer as a multimedia framework 
  * Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) libraries 

**STM32Cube™** is a comprehensive embedded software libraries and drivers, delivered for each STM32 series.
   * The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the Arm® core implemented in this STM32 product
   * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers : an abstraction drivers layer, the API ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio 
   * The BSP Drivers of each evaluation or demonstration board provided by this STM32 series 
   * A consistent set of middlewares components such as RTOS, OpenAMP, ...
   * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications or demonstrations) for each board provided by this STM32 series
